# Offline Crypto Yield & Payment Network

NoNetPay allows crypto users to send payments and check balances without internet access. Users create signed intents like "Send 5 USDC" which are shared over Bluetooth, SMS, or mesh WiFi. These messages are passed to a trusted relayer and then to a secure TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), which verifies the intent and signs the transaction using a AA wallet. Idle funds are automatically routed to DeFi lending protocols to earn passive yield.

## Protocol Overview

#### üß¨ Example Flow: Sending USDC Offline
User A (offline) creates a signed intent:
‚ÄúSend 5 USDC to User B‚Äù

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Bun runtime
- SQLite3
- DStack Simulator

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoNetPay/TEE-Message.git
cd TEE-Message
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
bun run seed.js
```

5. Start the DStack simulator:
```bash
# Make sure the simulator is running on the default port
```

6. Start the application:
```bash
bun run dev
```

The application will start two servers:
- Bun server on port 8000 (DStack routes)
- Express server on port 4000 (API endpoints)

## API Endpoints

### DStack Routes (Port 8000)

- `GET /`: Get DStack client information
- `GET /tdx_quote`: Get TDX quote
- `GET /tdx_quote_raw`: Get raw TDX quote
- `GET /derive_key`: Derive a key
- `GET /ethereum`: Get Ethereum address
- `GET /solana`: Get Solana address

### Express Routes (Port 4000)

- Message handling endpoints
- User management endpoints
- Authentication endpoints

## Development
